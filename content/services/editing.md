We edit and provide feedback on early drafts of your proposal and serve as a second set of eyes on your final draft. We deliver quick turnarounds for editing, copy editing, and proofreading requests of the following types of materials:

* Grant proposals, reports, and related collateral
* Grant pre-proposals and funder cultivation materials, such as letters of intent, one-sheeters, and white papers
* Proposals for major individual donors
