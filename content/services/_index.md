# Services to grow your organization's grant funding

## Our team can help you with:

### Research

We use a variety of sources to conduct grant prospect research, which includes finding new grant opportunities that align with your mission and programs.

### Writing

We collaborate with your team to write donor-facing materials, including:
- Grant proposals 
- Grant pre-proposal and funder cultivation materials, such as letters of intent, one-sheeters, and white papers
- Proposals for major individual donors

### Editing, copy editing, and proofreading

We provide editing and feedback on your early drafts of a proposal and serve as a second set of eyes on your final draft. We deliver quick turnarounds for editing, copy editing, and proofreading requests of the following types of materials:
* Grant proposals, reports, and related collateral
* Grant pre-proposals and funder cultivation materials, such as letters of intent, one-sheeters, and white papers
* Proposals for major individual donors
