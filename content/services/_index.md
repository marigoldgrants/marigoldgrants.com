## Research

We use a variety of sources to conduct grant prospect research, which includes finding new foundation and corporate grant opportunities that align with your mission and programs.

## Writing

We collaborate with your team to develop and write donor-facing materials, including:

* Grant proposals
* Grant pre-proposal and funder cultivation materials, such as letters of intent, one-sheeters, and white papers
* Proposals for major individual donors

## Editing, copy editing, and proofreading

We edit and provide feedback on early drafts of your proposal and serve as a second set of eyes on your final draft. We deliver quick turnarounds for editing, copy editing, and proofreading requests of the following types of materials:

* Grant proposals, reports, and related collateral
* Grant pre-proposals and funder cultivation materials, such as letters of intent, one-sheeters, and white papers
* Proposals for major individual donors

### **Rates**

Since each project is unique, rates vary per project and per service requested. Itâ€™s important for our team to have a thorough understanding of your project, via an initial consultation, so that we can provide you with an appropriate quote.

To request a free initial consultation, please contact us using this [**form**](../contact "Contact Form") or by emailing [**info@marigoldgrants.com**](mailto:info@marigoldgrants.com "Email"). You can expect a response within two business days.

_Please note that we do not work on commission, as this is considered unethical by most funders and professional organizations, including the Grant Professionals Association and Association of Fundraising Professionals._
