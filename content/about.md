## **Jessica Chevis, GPC, MA**

**Owner/Principal**

Jessica is an experienced grant professional who is motivated by engaging with people and organizations that are doing difficult but necessary work to make our world a more just, equitable, and joyous place to live. For the past eight years, she has dedicated her career to helping arts organizations and institutions of higher education generate support for their programs, operations, and capital projects from foundation, corporate, government, and individual donors. Jessica has worked with Louisiana State University, the LSU Foundation, the UC Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, UC Berkeley’s Cal Performances, and the Contemporary Arts Center New Orleans to craft nearly a hundred successful proposals that have secured more than $18 million in funding.

Jessica, a seventh generation New Orleanian, earned her B.A. in mass communication from Loyola University New Orleans and her M.A. in arts administration from the University of New Orleans. At present, she is the only Louisiana resident to hold the Grant Professional Certified (GPC) credential administered by the Grant Professionals Certification Institute. She is an active member of the Grant Professionals Association and has served as a grant panelist for the Arts Council of Greater Baton Rouge. In her free time, Jessica enjoys hanging out with her _very_ active rescue pup, getting lost in good books (mainly novels), experiencing art of all kinds, traveling, and volunteering as a literacy tutor.

## **Why Marigold?**

The marigold flower has many meanings, but Jessica’s favorite is that it symbolizes passion, creativity, and warmth—all traits she believes are essential to building meaningful relationships and producing compelling work.
